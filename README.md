# rerand


`rerand` is a python package containing tools for rerandomisation in randomised experiments.

For background on why we might want to rerandomise, and what that means for estimated treatment effects, see the [blog here](https://jackblun.github.io/pages_site/2025/07/16/rerandomisation_p1.html). An example of the package's functionality is given in docs/examples.

## Installation

The package is currently available on TestpyPI and can be installed as follows:

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ rerand==0.1.0`
