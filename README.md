# rerand

`rerand` is a python package containing tools for rerandomisation in randomised experiments.

For background on why we might want to rerandomise, and what that means for estimated treatment effects, see the [blog here](https://jackblundell.co.uk/posts/rerandomisation_p1/). An example of the package's functionality is given [here](https://github.com/jackblun/rerand/blob/develop/docs/examples/Example.ipynb).

## Installation

This is a simple work in progress package with limited dependencies. It is not currently hosted on PyPi.
